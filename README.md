Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health problem affecting nearly 10â€“15% of the adult population. It is characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function, often progressing silently until advanced stages. Major contributors include diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and aging, with significant variation across regions due to lifestyle, genetics, and access to healthcare. CKD not only increases the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant but also contributes to cardiovascular disease, infections, and reduced quality of life. Recognizing its epidemiology is crucial for guiding preventive strategies and reducing the overall disease burden.


Alzheimerâ€™s disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60â€“70% of cases worldwide. It is marked by progressive memory loss, decline in cognitive abilities, and changes in behavior, eventually interfering with daily activities. While age remains the greatest risk factor, other contributors include genetics, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and lifestyle factors. The growing elderly population means Alzheimerâ€™s prevalence is expected to rise sharply, creating significant social and economic challenges.


Efforts in prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimerâ€™s disease are increasingly emphasized in clinical practice. Regular cognitive screening in at-risk individuals, management of vascular risk factors, and adoption of healthy lifestyle measuresâ€”such as physical activity, balanced diet, social engagement, and mental stimulationâ€”are known to reduce risk. While current treatments mainly target symptoms, ongoing research into disease-modifying therapies offers hope for slowing progression. Early intervention, coupled with caregiver support and community awareness, remains the cornerstone of effective Alzheimerâ€™s care.
